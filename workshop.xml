	Dearest Ikkuna,
	We found the *s$@8} you sent. Strangely enough in the desert caverns. 
	If it works, these Rosettas should reach you on the otherside. 
	We hope you can find %{!#0a^3 under one of your altars. Its the lava lake one I believe.
	The Hermits have made great advancements in their shard-fuelled robotics program so I fear I don't have
	much time left. Oh yeah, and we have managed to track that ruby thief to the Soul Grove.
	I've dispatched a party down to it so hopefully we should be able to make that 3/9 shards found.
	Anyways I should get going now. Glass to find and all. I love you. Goodbye.
